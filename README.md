# grow_with_google

## Backstory
I was fortunate enough to be a Grow with Google Scholarship recipient in the Spring of 2018. Via Udacity.com, Google offered introductory coursework towards Android development, and these are my projects that came from those.

## Apps

### Birthday Card
This is the first Android application I made, simply working on layout constraints for Android's UI.

### Cookies
Cookies is a simple app that began using functionality of a button to alter the UI.

### Court Counter
This app took things further on the backend, allowing for a basketball game's score to be tracked.

### Hello Android
Hello Android is another simple UI interface application.

### Just Java
Just Java went a bit further, not only taking more user inputs, but calculating on the backend and then using Intents to send in an email!

### Menu
Menu provided a quick lesson in logging.

### Quiz App
This coding interview question application was the final project, bringing together all that was learned in this challenge course. It gives a multiple choice test to the user, scoring and presenting the results.

### Score Keeper
I may be most proud of Score Keeper for the simple fact that I, somewhat to my dismay, chose tennis as the sport to score in this one. The logic on the backend for scoring in this one took some time, but was definitely worth the hassle.
